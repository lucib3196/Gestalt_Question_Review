  "data": "This image contains a physics problem related to dynamics, specifically involving two blocks connected by a string over a frictionless pulley. \n\n1. **Diagram**: The image shows:\n   - A block of mass \\(m_1\\) resting on an incline at an angle of \\(\\theta = 20^{\\circ}\\).\n   - A second block of mass \\(m_2 = 2\\, kg\\) hanging vertically.\n   - Forces acting on the blocks, including the normal force \\(N\\), gravitational force, and frictional force.\n   - The acceleration \\(a\\) is highlighted as the quantity to be found.\n\n2. **Equations**: \n   - Values for gravitational force on block \\(m_2\\) and the component of gravitational force acting down the incline for block \\(m_1\\) are calculated: \n     - \\(F_2 = m_2g = 19.62\\, N\\)\n     - \\(F_1 = m_1g\\sin\\theta = 5.032\\, N\\)\n   - It indicates that \\(F_2\\) is greater than \\(F_1\\), leading to a frictional force acting against \\(F_2\\).\n   - A net force equation \\(\\Sigma F = ma = F_{net}\\) is provided, leading to the formula for acceleration involving both masses:\n     - \\( a = \\frac{F_{net} - m_1g\\cos\\epsilon_k - m_1g\\sin\\theta + m_2g}{m_1 + m_2} \\)\n\n3. **Definitions**: The image also defines the variables involved such as:\\n  - \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) for the masses of the blocks,\n  - \\(g\\) for acceleration due to gravity,\n  - \\(\\epsilon_k\\) for the kinetic friction coefficient."
